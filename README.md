# Description

This project ('[Brago](https://github.com/kfishkin/brago)') was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


This is a React app that takes a JSON file created by
Jake Croteau's Raid Extractor, and lets you examine it
in various simple ways. See the 'Help' command in the app
for more details.

This is my first React app, and was written as a personal
learning experiment, so be gentle with your comments :)

There's a lot of 'dead code' in there at present. My original
goal was to write a gear optimizer; when the Hell Hades one
came out I dropped the project. I then resumed it to add the
tips on 'bumping' and selling artifacts. But the stuff laying
the groundwork for optimizing is still there.
